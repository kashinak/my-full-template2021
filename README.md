# My very first web page


Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This is my first website on Gitpod. It is a Code Institute class exercise on building a simple website using html and css.  The website includes a horizontal navbar, custom fonts, logos and clickable links to information about all the coding technologies that are covered under Code Institutes's Full Stack Development course. This project provides the user the option to briefly glance through each page to see all the coding languages offered in the course using simple coding language logos against a simple white background. If the user wishes to take a deeper dive into learning more about each technology, the user has the option to click on the name link below their corresponding logo, which opens to a Wikipedia page providing an overview of the language. 

The rationale behind this site is to educate the new developer building a first website about current and upcoming coding technologies he/she is currently using and will eventually use in their current and future websites. Reading the Wikipedia articles about each technology is reinforced with the action of coding with that particular language to build he website. This learning style of action and reflection builds a strong foundation for strengthening new developer skills and builds interest and excitement while learning.

     * The two main colors are white and charcoal grey.
